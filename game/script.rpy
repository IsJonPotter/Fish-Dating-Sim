    "On a peaceful afternoon near the pier beach in Lake Well, 
    a girl in a pink dress is standing near the entrance of the pier as if she is waiting for someone to show up. 
    And that someone happened to be me."

    p "(She’s really here.)"

    "‘Bzzz bzzz’"

    "I got a message on my phone. I checked and saw that my friend messaged me “Good luck!”."

    "Today I’m going to finally ask her out! The girl in the pink dress is the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen."

    "I first saw her with friends walking by every weekend near the pier while I was helping my family unload the fish we caught here in the lake. 
    We’ve made a couple of eye contacts before and we would always look away."

    "I have made sure I’ve showered and dressed neatly for this day! I hope I don’t smell like fish. 
    Oh my god, I’m so nervous. No, I can’t sweat right now after the effort I put in. It’s time to go up to her."

    p "Gulp. H-hi!"

    "The girl turned around where the voice came from."

    c "Oh, I’ve seen you before. Are you the guy who fishes on that boat over there?"

    "The girl pointed out the boat that is owned by my family."

    c "Wait, are you the one who my friend set me up to come here? What’s up?"

    "‘Ba-dum ba-dum’"

    p "(Calm down, heart)"
